# Beam web setup

## Creating your project

Firstly log in to https://demo.beam3d.app/ and create a project. Then click the 'default' area. You can then add slots via the 'Add slot' button. These slots represent a list of places where chosen types of content can be Beamed in to your Unity experience. These can be updated later and seen in Unity via the 'Refresh content' option from the settings menu of the Beam window.

## Uploading your content

To start adding your content, click the Assets button, then the blue 'Add' button. From here choose a file from your system you want to Beam in. If you're happy, click the green 'Confirm' button and your file will be uploaded. Once that's done, simply give it a name and click 'Save'

## Creating a content layer

Click the projects link, select your project then the 'Content Layers' tab. From there click 'Add a Layer', give it a name, hit save then the blue pencil button.

In the content section you'll see a list of your slots. Click on the right section of each to assign the asset you just uploaded to the slot. It must be the correct type and match any settings you set when adding the Slots to your project in the first step.
